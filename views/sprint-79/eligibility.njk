          <p class="govuk-body">You can get Attendance Allowance if you’ve reached 
          <a href="#" class="govuk-link">State Pension age</a> 
          and the following apply (unless you might have 12 months or less to live):</p>

          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>you have a physical disability (including sensory disability, for example blindness), 
            a mental disability (including learning difficulties), or both</li>
            <li>your disability is severe enough for you to need help caring for yourself or someone 
            to supervise you, for your own or someone else’s safety</li>
            <li>you have needed that help for at least 6 months</li>

          <p class="govuk-body">You must also:</p>

          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>be in Great Britain when you claim - there are some exceptions, such as members and family members of the armed forces</li>
            <li>have been in Great Britain for at least 2 of the last 3 years (this does not apply if you’re a refugee or have humanitarian protection status)</li>
            <li>be <a href="#" class="govuk-link">habitually resident</a> in the UK, Ireland, Isle of Man or the Channel Islands</li>
            <li>not be subject to <a href="#" class="govuk-link">immigration control</a> (unless you’re a sponsored immigrant)</li>
            <li>not get <a href="#" class="govuk-link">Disability Living Allowance (DLA)</a>, 
            <a href="#" class="govuk-link">Personal Independence Payment (PIP)</a> or <a href="#" class="govuk-link">Adult Disability Payment (ADP)</a></li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">If you might have 12 months or less to live</h3>

          <p class="govuk-body">You can get Attendance Allowance more quickly and at the <a href="what-youll-get" class="govuk-link">higher rate</a> 
          if a medical professional has said you might have 12 months or less to live. This is sometimes called ‘special rules’.</p>

          <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">If you live in the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein</h3>

          <p class="govuk-body">You might still be able to get Attendance Allowance if you’re a UK national 
          and you live in or move to the EU, European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland.</p>

          <p class="govuk-body">Read guidance to <a href="#" class="govuk-link">find out if you can get benefits in the EU, EEA or Switzerland</a>.</p>

          <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">If you’re in a care home</h3>

          <p class="govuk-body">You cannot usually get Attendance Allowance if you live in a care home and your care is paid for by your local authority. 
          You can still claim Attendance Allowance if you pay for all your care home costs yourself.</p>

          <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">If you need an assessment</h3>

          <p class="govuk-body">You’ll only need to attend an assessment to check your eligibility if it’s unclear how your illness or disability affects you.</p>

          <p class="govuk-body">If you do need an assessment you’ll get a letter saying why and where you must go. 
          During the assessment, a medical professional will need to examine you.</p>
